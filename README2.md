# Iphone-dobot control
Welcome to Triple-S! üöÄThis is code repository for the paper **"Triple-S: A Collaborative Multi-LLM Framework for Solving Long-Horizon Implicative Tasks in Robotics"**.

We propose the Triple-S(Simplify-Solution-Summary) framework, which leverages the In-Context Learning capabilities of multiple LLMs to generate more robust policy code. This is a lightweight, training-free approach. The effectiveness and robustness of the Triple-S framework were validated through tests on the Long-horizon Desktop Implicative Placement[(LDIP)](dataset/README.md) dataset, which features long horizon tasks with implicative instructions in both observable and partially observable scenarios.

## üõ† Install
Install requirements for repository 
```
    # Install Robopal simulation environment
    cd robopal
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Install the main program dependencies
    cd ..
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## üèãÔ∏è Running


- gpt
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=[YOUR_KEY]
python server.py --doc --write "GPT3.5_LDIP1-ours"
python client_retrieval_gpt.py --doc --prompt "ours" --task "LDIP1"
```

- llama3
```
python server.py --doc --env2 --write "LLAMA3_LDIP2-ours"
python client_retrieval_llama3.py --doc --prompt "ours" --task "LDIP2"
```

The prediction file will be dumped in the `output` folder.

## üß™ Evaluation

```
cd output
